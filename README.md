# Spring-Boot-Backend-Application

This is a Backend Application that is currently being under development.
Already developed:
- JWT Authorization/Authentication layers
- Controller, Service and DAO layers
- APIs to support adding, removing, update and more
- Junit tests to test all APIs and confirm API logic is working

This application has been developed using Java and Spring Boot and JWT.
The purpose of the application is to serve as a backbone for other applications which is why I am implementing the CRUD functionality only here.
